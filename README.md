## Description

- It's a library app interface built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It include grid-based sections displaying cards that represent books, which can be added via a form, marked as read/unread and be removed.
- **Features:**
    - JavaScript’s object constructors
    - A grid-based layout
    - Interactive cards representing books
    - Interactive dialog box that shows a form to enter a new book
- Note: Some buttons are just decorative. The file input element for book cover is decorative and does not actually upload files. This is because, for security reasons, browsers do not allow access to the full local file path from an `<input type="file">`. The element is included only to simulate how a file selector would appear in a real application with a backend server.
